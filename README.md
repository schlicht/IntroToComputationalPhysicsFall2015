# IntroToComputationalPhysicsFall2015

My Introduction to Computational Physics Homework from Fall of 2015. The class was derived from the book [Computational Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Physics-Introduction-Franz-Vesely/dp/0306466317) and covers mainly stochastic processes and techniques for solving differential equations.

## Takeaways
* I didn't know how to write comments effectively
* I spent way to long debugging because of poor coding practices
* My TA is a genius for being able to find the causes of errors in my code
